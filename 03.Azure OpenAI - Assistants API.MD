## OpenAI Assistants API
### Overview

* The ai CLI allows you to create, manage, and interact with OpenAI's Assistants API.

* List all assistants - ``` ai chat assistant list ```
* Create an assistant - ``` ai chat assistant create --name MyAssistant ```
* Update an assistant - ``` ai chat assistant update --instructions @instructions.txt ```
* Delete an assistant - ``` ai chat assistant delete --id ID ```
* Verify the config - ``` ai config @assistant.id ```
* Set assistant by ID - ``` ai config --set assistant.id ID ```
* Clearing the assistant ID from the config - ``` ai config --clear assistant.id ```

## OpenAI Assistants Basics

* The ``` ai chat ``` commands allow you to create, manage, and interact with OpenAI's Assistants and persisted threads.

  ```  
    # Create a simple assistant
    ai chat assistant create --name MyAssistant
    
    # Start an interactive chat
    ai chat --interactive
    
    # Continue with a previous thread
    ai chat --interactive --thread-id ID
    
    # Ask a question and save the thread ID
    ai chat --question "..." --output-thread-id myNewThread.txt
    
    # Use a saved thread ID
    ai chat --question "..." --thread-id @myNewThread.txt
    
    # Interactive chat with thread ID and save history
    ai chat --interactive --thread-id @myNewThread.txt --output-chat-history history.jsonl
  ```

* Generate, build, and run a sample - <a href="https://thebookof.ai/openai-asst/openai-asst-streaming-cs/sample-overview/">C# code</a>
  ```
  ai dev new openai-asst-streaming --csharp
  cd openai-asst-streaming-cs
  
  dotnet restore
  
  ai dev shell
  dotnet run
  ```

### OpenAI Assistants with Code Interpreter
* The ai CLI allows you to create, manage, and interact with OpenAI's Assistants, including use of Code Interpreter.
  ```
  # Create Assistant with Code Interpreter
  ai chat assistant create --name MyCodeAssistant --code-interpreter
  
  # Update Assistant with Code Interpreter
  ai chat assistant update --code-interpreter
  
  # Use Code Interpreter. Interactive Chat with Code Interpreter
  ai chat --interactive --question "how many e's are there in the pledge of allegiance?"
  
  # Delete Assistant
  ai chat assistant delete
  
  # Clear Assistant ID
  ai config --clear assistant.id
  ```

* Generate, build, and run a sample - <a href="https://thebookof.ai/openai-asst/openai-asst-streaming-with-code-cs/sample-overview/">C#</a>
  ``` 
  ai dev new openai-asst-streaming-with-code --csharp
  cd openai-asst-streaming-with-code-cs
  ```

### OpenAI Assistants with Function Calling

* The ai CLI allows you to extend OpenAI's models with custom functions (e.g. dates, times, math, filesystem).

  ```
  # Create an assistant
  ai chat assistant create --name MyFunctionAssistant
  
  # Use the Assistant with Built-in Function Calling
  
  # Ask the assistant the current time
  ai chat --user "What time is it?" --built-in-functions
  
  # Calculate a power
  ai chat --user "What is 3.5 to the power of 9?" --built-in-functions
  
  # Read a file
  ai chat --user "What is in the README.md file?" --built-in-functions
  
  # Save content to a file
  ai chat --user "Save the pledge of allegiance to 'pledge.txt'" --built-in-functions
  
  # Delete the Assistant
  ai chat assistant delete
  ai config --clear assistant.id
  ```

* Generate, build, and run a sample - <a href="https://thebookof.ai/openai-asst/openai-asst-streaming-with-functions-cs/sample-overview/">C# code</a>
  ```
  ai dev new openai-asst-streaming-with-functions --csharp
  ```

### OpenAI Assistants with File Search
* The ai CLI allows you to extend OpenAI's models with custom data sources using File Search.

  ```
    # Create assistant with file search
    ai chat assistant create --name MyFileAssistant --files "**/*.md"
    
    # Update assistant's file search
    ai chat assistant update --files "**/*.txt"
    
    # List vector stores
    ai chat assistant vector-store list
    
    # Get vector store
    ai chat assistant vector-store get
    
    # See persisted config
    ai config @assistant.id
    ai config @vector.store.id
    
    # Update Vector Store directly - with one file
    ai chat assistant vector-store update --file README.md
    
    # Update vector store with many files
    ai chat assistant vector-store update --files "**/*.txt"
    
    # Use File Search
    # Query with file search
    ai chat --user "Find information on markdown files."
    
    # Interactive query with file search
    ai chat --user "Search for details on the latest updates." --interactive
    
    # Delete the assistant
    ai chat assistant delete
    ai config --clear assistant.id
    
    # Delete the vector store
    ai chat assistant vector-store delete
    ai config --clear vector.store.id
  ```

* Generate, build, and run a sample - <a href="https://thebookof.ai/openai-asst/openai-asst-streaming-with-file-search-cs/sample-overview/">c#</a>
  ```
    ai dev new openai-asst-streaming-with-file-search --csharp
  ```
